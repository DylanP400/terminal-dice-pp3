# Terminal Dice
**Terminal Dice** is a game of chance that mimics the popular casino game called Craps or Casino Dice. It runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. The game involves rolling a pair of dice, and depending on the outcome, the player either wins or loses. The player must win the game on their first attempt, or they need to roll their point twice in a row to win. The game continues until the player decides to stop playing.
