# Terminal Dice
**Terminal Dice** is a game of chance that mimics the popular casino game called Craps or Casino Dice. It runs in the Code Institute mock terminal on Heroku. The game involves rolling a pair of dice, and depending on the outcome, the player either wins or loses. The player must win the game on their first attempt, or they need to roll their point twice in a row to win. The game continues until the player decides to stop playing.

# How to play

1. The player rolls the dice and adds the numbers together.
2. If the total is 7 or 11 the player wins.
3. If the total is 2, 3, or 12, the player loses.
4. If the total is any other number 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10 that number becomes the point.
5. The player then continues to roll the dice until they either roll the point again and win or they roll a 7 or 11 and lose.






















 <!-- bugs 
the game_logic keeps printing the same dice over and over again - I had the varible in global scope and i never passed my function a argument
